# AEPatch2
AEPatch2 is a Sponge plugin that uses Mixin to change the code of Applied Energistics 2 at runtime and patch some issues. At the moment, it just gives the AE2 Fake Player a name ([AE2] instead the generic [Minecraft]). I'll be using this to patch eventual issues later.

## Running
To run this, **you must rename your AE2 jar file to ae2.jar**, so this mod can patch it. It'll throw an error if the mod doesn't exist. Also, this plugin will only load if it's in the **mods** folder.
AEPatch2 is built against AE2 rv6-stable-2, but it should work on earlier versions. 

The compiled jar is in the releases section. Enjoy it!
